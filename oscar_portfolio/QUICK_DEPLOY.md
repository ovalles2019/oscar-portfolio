# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide

## âœ… Your Portfolio is Ready!

Your Flutter portfolio with AI chat is built and ready to deploy.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Easiest Deployment Options**

2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **Click**: "New site from Git"
4. **Choose**: Your `oscar-portfolio` repository
5. **Configure**:
   - **Build command**: `flutter build web --release`
   - **Publish directory**: `build/web`
   - **Base directory**: `oscar_portfolio`
6. **Deploy!**

### **Option 2: Manual Upload to Netlify**

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Drag & Drop**: The `build/web` folder
3. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE`

### **Option 3: GitHub Pages**

1. **Go to**: Repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. **Source**: Deploy from a branch
3. **Branch**: `gh-pages`
4. **Upload**: `build/web` contents to `gh-pages` branch

## ðŸ”§ **Why Vercel Didn't Work**
